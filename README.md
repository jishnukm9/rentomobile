Overview:

  Rentomobile is an innovative car booking platform designed to streamline the process of renting vehicles for users. Developed using React, this web application leverages cutting-edge technologies and industry- 
  standard APIs to deliver a user-friendly, efficient, and secure car rental experience.

Technologies Used:

  React: Utilized for building the user interface, React’s component-based architecture facilitates efficient management of the site’s views and states, allowing for dynamic updates and scalable features.
  React Router: This tool provides seamless navigation between different pages and components without refreshing the browser, making the user experience smooth and consistent.
  React Query: Used for fetching, caching, and updating the data in the application, React Query optimizes data synchronization with the backend, reducing the need for manual state management and improving         
  performance.
  Context API: This feature of React enables state management within the app, which is crucial for maintaining the states related to user authentication, session management, and settings across various components 
  without prop drilling.
  Avis Car Booking API: Integrating Avis API allows Rentomobile to offer a wide range of vehicles for rent, handling bookings, and managing vehicle information directly through Avis’s robust system. This 
  integration ensures up-to-date access to vehicle availability and rates, enhancing the booking process.
